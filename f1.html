      <h2>Saftey Cars</h2>
      <p>A safety car is a car that is used to slow down the pace of a race when there is a hazard on the track. This can be due to an accident, debris on the track, or bad weather conditions. The safety car is driven by a professional driver and is equipped with flashing lights and a yellow flag to indicate to the drivers that they must slow down. When the safety car is deployed, all of the drivers must line up behind it and remain at a certain distance from it. The drivers are not allowed to overtake each other or race each other while the safety car is on the track. The safety car will remain on the track until the hazard has been cleared and it is safe for the race to resume.</p>

      <h2>Pit Stops</h2>
      <p>A pit stop is a pause in a race for a driver to change tires, make repairs, or make mechanical adjustments. Pit stops are an essential part of racing, as they allow drivers to maintain their car's performance and safety throughout a race. Pit stops are typically very quick, with the fastest pit stops taking under two seconds. This is due to the fact that pit crews are highly trained and practice pit stops extensively. Each member of the pit crew has a specific role, and they work together in a choreographed manner to ensure that the pit stop is completed as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
